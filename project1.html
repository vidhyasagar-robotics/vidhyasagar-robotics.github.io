            <h2 class="heading"> The <span>Cleaning Robot</span></h2>
            <p>This project was developed with the aim of providing contactless cleaning services for public restrooms, ensuring the safety and well-being of sanitation employees. In public restrooms, the risk of infection is significantly high, making it crucial to minimize human contact during cleaning tasks. The solution involves the development of a specialized robot designed to assist in janitorial tasks within washrooms.

                <br><br> The robot is capable of performing various cleaning tasks partially autonomously. It autonomously navigates the restroom space, while certain tasks such as mopping the floor, spraying sanitizers on countertops and commodes, and blow-drying are performed manually. Additionally, manual picking of trash from the floor is also carried out.
                
                <br><br> The future work aims to enhance the robot's capabilities to perform all tasks autonomously, reducing the need for manual intervention. By achieving full autonomy, a highly efficient and effective solution for maintaining cleanliness in public restrooms are envisioned while minimizing the risk of infections.</p>
