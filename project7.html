            <p class='video-description'>This manipulator was designed to remove weeds and to pick and place objects by changing the end effector. The computer vision system used in this manipulator is capable of identifying and locating objects within its field of view, converting the captured visual data into coordinates. These coordinates are then used by the delta manipulator to precisely move, pick, and place objects.</p>
  
            <p><b>Key Features and Functionality:</b>

                <br><br><b> For weed removal,</b> The vision system identifies the weed based on its shape, color, or other distinguishing features. Once a weed is identified, the Delta manipulator moves to the location of the weed. The mechanical tool, which could be a gripper or a cutting tool, then removes the weed from the ground.

                
                <br><br><b>For pick-and-place tasks,</b>the Delta manipulator could also utilize a vision system to identify and locate the objects to be picked. The manipulator then moves to the object's location, picks it up with a gripper or suction cup, and places it in the desired location
